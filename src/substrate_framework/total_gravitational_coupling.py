"""Derived usable total gravitational coupling (P231, advances #88).

Issue #88 asks for the framework's first derived usable total gravitational
coupling

    1/G_total = 1/G_baseline + Delta(1/G)

as a governed renormalization condition with declared substrate provenance,
composed from accepted claims ``C-GRV-001`` (dimensional permission and
independent additive-baseline ledger) and ``C-IGR-001..003`` (exact
constant-mass one-loop coefficient families for the sharp, smooth, and
power-subtracted prescriptions).  This module delivers four objects:

``scheme_selection_ledger``
    The substrate-internal selection derivation.  Three exact structural
    legs decide which of the three accepted scheme families can enter a
    usable renormalization condition: (L1) strict spectral positivity of the
    curvature-class scale factor J(z) = I_2/Lambda**2, inherited from the
    positive operator spectrum because J is the integral of a strictly
    positive integrand; (L2) strict monotone large-mass decoupling, because
    the same integrand decreases pointwise in z = m**2/Lambda**2; (L3)
    cutoff-ontology closure, because the scheme's scale must be able to
    carry C-GRV-001's cutoff identification E_cut = hbar*c/a.  Sharp and
    smooth pass all three; the power-subtracted family fails L1 and L2
    (J(z) = z*(log z + EulerGamma - 1) changes sign at the exact root
    z* = exp(1 - EulerGamma)) and fails L3 (mu is a subtraction scale with
    no cutoff identification).  The usable set is therefore an output of
    substrate structure, not a choice.

``total_inverse_gravity_coupling``
    The composed renormalization condition
    1/G_total = B + N*(1-6*xi)*J(z)*Lambda**2/(12*pi) with the induced shift
    taken from the accepted ``scalar_one_loop_mass`` API (accepted-canon
    implementation of C-IGR-001..003; this module never re-implements the
    coefficient families), the baseline B an exact real declared input, and
    the total sign classified exactly (attractive Newtonian iff
    1/G_total > 0).

``attractive_sign_map``
    The exact necessary-and-sufficient total-sign conditions on the full
    declared parameter domain, scheme-uniform over the usable set because
    0 < J(z) <= 1 holds for both usable schemes: sub-conformal xi < 1/6,
    conformal xi = 1/6 (marginal: Delta = 0 identically, so the purely
    induced reading gives 1/G_total = 0, neither attractive nor
    repulsive), and super-conformal xi > 1/6.  Includes the
    uniform-in-mass thresholds using the exact worst case J(0) = 1, and the
    purely-induced reading B = 0 whose exact verdict is attractive iff
    xi < 1/6, independent of N, m**2, Lambda, and the usable scheme.

``higher_curvature_control_ledger``
    The control ledger for every term that can defeat the claimed regime:
    the tau**-1 curvature-squared class (exactly -dJ/dz per scheme: E1(z)
    sharp, 2*K_0(2*sqrt(z)) smooth, log(z)+EulerGamma power-subtracted),
    the tau**-3 vacuum class from the accepted families, and the nonlocal
    remainder, each with its predeclared bounding domain.  The control ratio
    L/J is finite but not uniformly bounded as z -> 0 (it diverges
    logarithmically), so the predeclared domain fixes z >= z_min > 0; on
    [z_min, inf) the ratio is monotone decreasing per scheme and the bound
    L(z_min)/J(z_min) is exact.

Authority note.  ``C-IGR-001..003`` (v0.161.0) and ``C-GRV-001`` (v0.68.0)
are the only accepted scientific inputs; ``scalar_one_loop_mass`` is their
accepted-canon implementation and is imported, not duplicated.  The landed
conditional ``scalar_induced_newton`` module remains implementation reuse
only.  Nothing here selects an observed G, enters an empirical comparator,
borrows an Einstein-Hilbert coefficient, solves a sourced geometry, or
predicts a radiative quantity.  The additive baseline B stays a declared
premise; where B = 0 is adopted (the purely-induced reading) its downstream
ceiling is quoted exactly: the total value remains scheme-bracketed by the
exact spread ratio R(z) = J_smooth/J_sharp (1 at z = 0, exactly
2*e*K_1(2)/(1 - e*E_1(1)) = 1.88377257808... at z = 1, unbounded as
z -> inf), so this rung derives the usable scheme set, the sign map, and
the control bounds, not a unique numeric normalization.
